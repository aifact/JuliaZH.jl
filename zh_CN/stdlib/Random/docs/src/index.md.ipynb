    "2) creating new generators\n",

    "The API for 1) is quite functional, but is relatively recent so it may still have to evolve in subsequent releases of the `Random` module.\n",

    "\n",
    "Generating random values for some distributions may involve various trade-offs. *Pre-computed* values, such as an [alias table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_method) for discrete distributions, or [“squeezing” functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling) for univariate distributions, can speed up sampling considerably. How much information should be pre-computed can depend on the number of values we plan to draw from a distribution. Also, some random number generators can have certain properties that various algorithms may want to exploit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Random` module defines a customizable framework for obtaining random values that can address these issues. Each invocation of `rand` generates a *sampler* which can be customized with the above trade-offs in mind, by adding methods to `Sampler`, which in turn can dispatch on the random number generator, the object that characterizes the distribution, and a suggestion for the number of repetitions. Currently, for the latter, `Val{1}` (for a single sample) and `Val{Inf}` (for an arbitrary number) are used, with `Random.Repetition` an alias for both.\n",

    "By using an RNG parameter initialized with a given seed, you can reproduce the same pseudorandom number sequence when running your program multiple times.  However, a minor release of Julia (e.g. 1.3 to 1.4) *may change* the sequence of pseudorandom numbers generated from a specific seed.  (Even if the sequence produced by a low-level function like [`rand`](@ref) does not change, the output of higher-level functions like [`randsubseq`](@ref) may change due to algorithm updates.)   Rationale: guaranteeing that pseudorandom streams never change prohibits many algorithmic improvements.\n",

    "Software tests that rely on *specific* \"random\" data should also generally save the data or embed it into the test code.  On the other hand, tests that should pass for *most* random data (e.g. testing `A \\ (A*x) ≈ x` for a random matrix `A = randn(n,n)`) can use an RNG with a fixed seed to ensure that simply running the test many times does not encounter a failure due to very improbable data (e.g. an extremely ill-conditioned matrix).\n",
