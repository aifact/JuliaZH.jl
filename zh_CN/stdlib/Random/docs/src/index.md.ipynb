    "Generating random values for some distributions may involve various trade-offs. *Pre-computed* values, such as an [alias table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_method) for discrete distributions, or [“squeezing” functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling) for univariate distributions, can speed up sampling considerably. How much information should be pre-computed can depend on the number of values we plan to draw from a distribution. Also, some random number generators can have certain properties that various algorithms may want to exploit.\n",

    "The `Random` module defines a customizable framework for obtaining random values that can address these issues. Each invocation of `rand` generates a *sampler* which can be customized with the above trade-offs in mind, by adding methods to `Sampler`, which in turn can dispatch on the random number generator, the object that characterizes the distribution, and a suggestion for the number of repetitions. Currently, for the latter, `Val{1}` (for a single sample) and `Val{Inf}` (for an arbitrary number) are used, with `Random.Repetition` an alias for both.\n",
