    "# 调用 C 和 Fortran 代码\n",
    "\n",
    "在数值计算领域，尽管有很多用 C 语言或 Fortran 写的高质量且成熟的库都可以用 Julia 重写，但为了便捷利用现有的 C 或 Fortran 代码，Julia 提供简洁且高效的调用方式。Julia 的哲学是 `no boilerplate`：\n",
    "Julia 可以直接调用 C/Fortran 的函数，不需要任何\"胶水\"代码，代码生成或其它编译过程 -- 即使在交互式会话 (REPL/Jupyter notebook) 中使用也一样. 在 Julia 中，上述特性可以仅仅通过调用 [`ccall`](@ref) 实现，它的语法看起来就像是普通的函数调用。\n",
    "\n",
    "The code to be called must be available as a shared library. Most C and Fortran libraries ship\n",
    "compiled as shared libraries already, but if you are compiling the code yourself using GCC (or\n",
    "Clang), you will need to use the `-shared` and `-fPIC` options. The machine instructions generated\n",
    "by Julia's JIT are the same as a native C call would be, so the resulting overhead is the same\n",
    "as calling a library function from C code. [^1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Shared libraries and functions are referenced by a tuple of the form `(:function, \"library\")`\n",
    "or `(\"function\", \"library\")` where `function` is the C-exported function name, and `library` refers\n",
    "to the shared library name.  Shared libraries available in the (platform-specific) load path will\n",
    "be resolved by name.  The full path to the library may also be specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "可以单独使用函数名来代替元组（只用 `:function` 或 `\"function\"`）。在这种情况下，函数名在当前进程中进行解析。这一调用形式可用于调用 C 库函数、Julia 运行时中的函数或链接到 Julia 的应用程序中的函数。\n",
    "\n",
    "默认情况下，Fortran 编译器会[进行名称修饰](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling#Fortran)（例如，将函数名转换为小写或大写，通常会添加下划线），要通过 [`ccall`](@ref) 调用 Fortran 函数，传递的标识符必须与 Fortran 编译器名称修饰之后的一致。此外，在调用 Fortran 函数时，**所有**输入必须以指针形式传递，并已在堆或栈上分配内存。这不仅适用于通常是堆分配的数组及可变对象，而且适用于整数和浮点数等标量值，尽管这些值通常是栈分配的，且在使用 C 或 Julia 调用约定时通常是通过寄存器传递的。\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can use [`ccall`](@ref) to actually generate a call to the library function. The arguments\n",
    "to [`ccall`](@ref) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A `(:function, \"library\")` pair (most common),\n",
    "\n",
    "   或\n",
    "\n",
    "   a `:function` name symbol or `\"function\"` name string (for symbols in the current process or libc),\n",
    "\n",
    "   或\n",
    "\n",
    "   一个函数指针（例如，从 `dlsym` 获得的指针）。\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The function's return type\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A tuple of input types, corresponding to the function signature\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The actual argument values to be passed to the function, if any; each is a separate parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! note\n",
    "    The `(:function, \"library\")` pair, return type, and input types must be literal constants\n",
    "    (i.e., they can't be variables, but see [Non-constant Function Specifications](@ref) below)."
