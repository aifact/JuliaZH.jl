    "## Julia Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "整个进程的千里之行如下：\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 用户打开了 `julia`。\n",
    "2. The C function `main()` from `cli/loader_exe.c` gets called. This function processes the command line\n",
    "   arguments, filling in the `jl_options` struct and setting the variable `ARGS`. It then initializes\n",
    "   在 `ui/repl.c` 中的 C 语言的函数 `main()` 被调用。这个函数处理命令行参数，填充到 `jl_options` 结构图并且设置变了 `ARGS` 。接下来初始化 Julia (通过调用  [`julia_init` in `task.c`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/src/task.c)\n",
    "   which may load a previously compiled [sysimg](@ref dev-sysimg)). Finally, it passes off control to Julia\n",
    "   by calling [`Base._start()`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/base/client.jl).\n",
    "3. When `_start()` takes over control, the subsequent sequence of commands depends on the command\n",
    "   line arguments given. For example, if a filename was supplied, it will proceed to execute that\n",
    "   file. Otherwise, it will start an interactive REPL.\n",
    "4. Skipping the details about how the REPL interacts with the user, let's just say the program ends\n",
    "   up with a block of code that it wants to run.\n",
    "5. If the block of code to run is in a file, [`jl_load(char *filename)`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/src/toplevel.c)\n",
    "   gets invoked to load the file and [parse](@ref dev-parsing) it. Each fragment of code is then passed to `eval`\n",
    "   to execute.\n",
    "6. Each fragment of code (or AST), is handed off to [`eval()`](@ref) to turn into results.\n",
    "7. [`eval()`](@ref) takes each code fragment and tries to run it in [`jl_toplevel_eval_flex()`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/src/toplevel.c).\n",
    "8. `jl_toplevel_eval_flex()` decides whether the code is a \"toplevel\" action (such as `using` or\n",
    "   `module`), which would be invalid inside a function. If so, it passes off the code to the toplevel\n",
    "   interpreter.\n",
    "9. `jl_toplevel_eval_flex()` then [expands](@ref dev-macro-expansion) the code to eliminate any macros and to \"lower\"\n",
    "   the AST to make it simpler to execute.\n",
    "10. `jl_toplevel_eval_flex()` then uses some simple heuristics to decide whether to JIT compiler the\n",
    "    AST or to interpret it directly.\n",
    "11. The bulk of the work to interpret code is handled by [`eval` in `interpreter.c`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/src/interpreter.c).\n",
    "12. If instead, the code is compiled, the bulk of the work is handled by `codegen.cpp`. Whenever a\n",
    "    Julia function is called for the first time with a given set of argument types, [type inference](@ref dev-type-inference)\n",
    "    will be run on that function. This information is used by the [codegen](@ref dev-codegen) step to generate\n",
    "    faster code.\n",
    "13. Eventually, the user quits the REPL, or the end of the program is reached, and the `_start()`\n",
    "    method returns.\n",
    "14. Just before exiting, `main()` calls [`jl_atexit_hook(exit_code)`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/src/init.c).\n",
    "    This calls `Base._atexit()` (which calls any functions registered to [`atexit()`](@ref) inside\n",
    "    Julia). Then it calls [`jl_gc_run_all_finalizers()`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/src/gc.c).\n",
    "    Finally, it gracefully cleans up all `libuv` handles and waits for them to flush and close.\n",

    "## [Parsing](@id dev-parsing)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Julia parser is a small lisp program written in femtolisp, the source-code for which is distributed\n",
    "inside Julia in [src/flisp](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/tree/master/src/flisp).\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface functions for this are primarily defined in [`jlfrontend.scm`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/src/jlfrontend.scm).\n",
    "The code in [`ast.c`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/src/ast.c) handles this handoff\n",
