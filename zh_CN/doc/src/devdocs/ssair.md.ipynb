    "\n",
    "Beginning in Julia 0.7, parts of the compiler use a new [SSA-form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form)\n",
    "intermediate representation. Historically, the compiler used to directly generate LLVM IR, from a lowered form of the Julia\n",
    "AST. This form had most syntactic abstractions removed, but still looked a lot like an abstract syntax tree.\n",
    "Over time, in order to facilitate optimizations, SSA values were introduced to this IR and the IR was\n",
    "linearized (i.e. a form where function arguments may only be SSA values or constants). However, non-SSA values\n",
    "(slots) remained in the IR due to the lack of Phi nodes in the IR (necessary for back-edges and re-merging of\n",
    "conditional control flow), negating much of the usefulness of the SSA form representation to perform\n",
    "middle end optimizations. Some heroic effort was put into making these optimizations work without a complete SSA\n",
    "form representation, but the lack of such a representation ultimately proved prohibitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## New IR nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "With the new IR representation, the compiler learned to handle four new IR nodes, Phi nodes, Pi\n",
    "nodes as well as PhiC nodes and Upsilon nodes (the latter two are only used for exception handling).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phi nodes and Pi nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Phi nodes are part of generic SSA abstraction (see the link above if you're not familiar with\n",
    "the concept). In the Julia IR, these nodes are represented as:"

    "all its uses without explicitly computing this map--def lists however are trivial since you can look up the\n",
    "corresponding statement from the index), so the LLVM-style RAUW (replace-all-uses-with) operation is unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We keep a separate buffer of nodes to insert (including the position to insert them at, the type of the\n",

    "- RAUW style operations are performed by setting the corresponding statement index to the replacement\n",
    "  value.\n",
    "- Statements are erased by setting the corresponding statement to `nothing` (this is essentially just a special-case\n",
    "  convention of the above.\n",
    "- If there are any uses of the statement being erased, they will be set to `nothing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a `compact!` function that compacts the above data structure by performing the insertion of nodes in the appropriate place, trivial copy propagation, and renaming of uses to any changed SSA values. However, the clever part\n",
    "of this scheme is that this compaction can be done lazily as part of the subsequent pass. Most optimization passes\n",
    "need to walk over the entire list of statements, performing analysis or modifications along the way. We provide an\n",
    "`IncrementalCompact` iterator that can be used to iterate over the statement list. It will perform any necessary compaction\n",
