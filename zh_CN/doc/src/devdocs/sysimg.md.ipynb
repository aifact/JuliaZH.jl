    "## Building the Julia system image\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia ships with a preparsed system image containing the contents of the `Base` module, named\n",
    "`sys.ji`.  This file is also precompiled into a shared library called `sys.{so,dll,dylib}` on\n",
    "as many platforms as possible, so as to give vastly improved startup times.  On systems that do\n",
    "not ship with a precompiled system image file, one can be generated from the source files shipped\n",
    "in Julia's `DATAROOTDIR/julia/base` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation is useful for multiple reasons.  A user may:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Build a precompiled shared library system image on a platform that did not ship with one, thereby\n",
    "    improving startup times.\n",
    "  * Modify `Base`, rebuild the system image and use the new `Base` next time Julia is started.\n",
    "  * Include a `userimg.jl` file that includes packages into the system image, thereby creating a system\n",
    "    image that has packages embedded into the startup environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`PackageCompiler.jl` package](https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl) contains convenient\n",

    "\n",
    "The system image can be compiled simultaneously for multiple CPU microarchitectures\n",
    "under the same instruction set architecture (ISA). Multiple versions of the same function\n",
    "may be created with minimum dispatch point inserted into shared functions\n",

    "\n",
    "### Specifying multiple system image targets\n",
    "\n",
    "A multi-microarchitecture system image can be enabled by passing multiple targets\n",
    "during system image compilation. This can be done either with the `JULIA_CPU_TARGET` make option\n",
    "or with the `-C` command line option when running the compilation command manually.\n",
    "Multiple targets are separated by `;` in the option string.\n",
    "The syntax for each target is a CPU name followed by multiple features separated by `,`.\n",
    "All features supported by LLVM are supported and a feature can be disabled with a `-` prefix.\n",
    "(`+` prefix is also allowed and ignored to be consistent with LLVM syntax).\n",
    "Additionally, a few special features are supported to control the function cloning behavior.\n",
