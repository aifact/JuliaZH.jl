    "## Types and sets (and `Any` and `Union{}`/`Bottom`)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's perhaps easiest to conceive of Julia's type system in terms of sets. While programs manipulate\n",
    "individual values, a type refers to a set of values. This is not the same thing as a collection;\n",
    "for example a [`Set`](@ref) of values is itself a single `Set` value.\n",
    "Rather, a type describes a set of *possible* values, expressing uncertainty about which value we\n",
    "have.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *concrete* type `T` describes the set of values whose direct tag, as returned by the [`typeof`](@ref)\n",
    "function, is `T`. An *abstract* type describes some possibly-larger set of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "[`Any`](@ref) describes the entire universe of possible values. [`Integer`](@ref) is a subset of\n",
    "`Any` that includes `Int`, [`Int8`](@ref), and other concrete types.\n",
    "Internally, Julia also makes heavy use of another type known as `Bottom`, which can also be written\n",
    "as `Union{}`. This corresponds to the empty set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia's types support the standard operations of set theory: you can ask whether `T1` is a \"subset\"\n",
    "(subtype) of `T2` with `T1 <: T2`. Likewise, you intersect two types using [`typeintersect`](@ref), take\n",
    "their union with [`Union`](@ref), and compute a type that contains their union with [`typejoin`](@ref):"
