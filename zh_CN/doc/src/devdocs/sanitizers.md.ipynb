    "\n",
    "An easy solution is to have an dedicated build folder for providing a matching toolchain, by building\n",

    "For detecting or debugging memory bugs, you can use Clang's [address sanitizer (ASAN)](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html).\n",
    "By compiling with `SANITIZE=1` you enable ASAN for the Julia compiler and its generated code.\n",
    "In addition, you can specify `LLVM_SANITIZE=1` to sanitize the LLVM library as well. Note that\n",
    "these options incur a high performance and memory cost. For example, using ASAN for Julia and\n",
    "LLVM makes `testall1` takes 8-10 times as long while using 20 times as much memory (this can be\n",
    "reduced to respectively a factor of 3 and 4 by using the options described below).\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Julia sets the `allow_user_segv_handler=1` ASAN flag, which is required for signal\n",
    "delivery to work properly. You can define other options using the `ASAN_OPTIONS` environment flag,\n",
    "in which case you'll need to repeat the default option mentioned before. For example, memory usage\n",
    "can be reduced by specifying `fast_unwind_on_malloc=0` and `malloc_context_size=2`, at the cost\n",
    "of backtrace accuracy. For now, Julia also sets `detect_leaks=0`, but this should be removed in\n",
