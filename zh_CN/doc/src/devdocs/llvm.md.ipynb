    "### Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary difficulty is thus choosing an IR representation that allows us to\n",
    "identify GC-tracked pointers and their uses, even after the program has been\n",
    "run through the optimizer. Our design makes use of three LLVM features to achieve\n",
    "this:\n",
    "- Custom address spaces\n",
    "- Operand Bundles\n",
    "- Non-integral pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom address spaces allow us to tag every point with an integer that needs\n",
    "to be preserved through optimizations. The compiler may not insert casts between\n",
    "address spaces that did not exist in the original program and it must never\n",
    "change the address space of a pointer on a load/store/etc operation. This allows\n",
    "us to annotate which pointers are GC-tracked in an optimizer-resistant way. Note\n",
    "that metadata would not be able to achieve the same purpose. Metadata is supposed\n",
    "to always be discardable without altering the semantics of the program. However,\n",
    "failing to identify a GC-tracked pointer alters the resulting program behavior\n",
    "dramatically - it'll probably crash or return wrong results. We currently use\n",
    "three different address spaces (their numbers are defined in `src/codegen_shared.cpp`):\n",
    "\n",
    "- GC Tracked Pointers (currently 10): These are pointers to boxed values that may be put\n",
    "  into a GC frame. It is loosely equivalent to a `jl_value_t*` pointer on the C\n",
    "  side. N.B. It is illegal to ever have a pointer in this address space that may\n",
    "  not be stored to a GC slot.\n",
    "- Derived Pointers (currently 11): These are pointers that are derived from some GC\n",
    "  tracked pointer. Uses of these pointers generate uses of the original pointer.\n",
    "  However, they need not themselves be known to the GC. The GC root placement\n",
    "  pass MUST always find the GC tracked pointer from which this pointer is\n",
    "  derived and use that as the pointer to root.\n",
    "- Callee Rooted Pointers (currently 12): This is a utility address space to express the\n",
    "  notion of a callee rooted value. All values of this address space MUST be\n",
    "  storable to a GC root (though it is possible to relax this condition in the\n",
    "  future), but unlike the other pointers need not be rooted if passed to a\n",
    "  call (they do still need to be rooted if they are live across another safepoint\n",
    "  between the definition and the call).\n",
    "- Pointers loaded from tracked object (currently 13): This is used by arrays,\n",
    "  which themselves contain a pointer to the managed data. This data area is owned\n",
    "  by the array, but is not a GC-tracked object by itself. The compiler guarantees\n",
    "  that as long as this pointer is live, the object that this pointer was loaded\n",
    "  from will keep being live.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Invariants\n",
    "\n",
    "The GC root placement pass makes use of several invariants, which need\n",
    "to be observed by the frontend and are preserved by the optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, only the following address space casts are allowed:\n",
    "- 0->{Tracked,Derived,CalleeRooted}: It is allowable to decay an untracked pointer to any of the\n",
    "  others. However, do note that the optimizer has broad license to not root\n",
    "  such a value. It is never safe to have a value in address space 0 in any part\n",
    "  of the program if it is (or is derived from) a value that requires a GC root.\n",
    "- Tracked->Derived: This is the standard decay route for interior values. The placement\n",
    "  pass will look for these to identify the base pointer for any use.\n",
    "- Tracked->CalleeRooted: Addrspace CalleeRooted serves merely as a hint that a GC root is not\n",
    "  required. However, do note that the Derived->CalleeRooted decay is prohibited, since\n",
    "  pointers should generally be storable to a GC slot, even in this address space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us consider what constitutes a use:\n",
    "- Loads whose loaded values is in one of the address spaces\n",
    "- Stores of a value in one of the address spaces to a location\n",
    "- Stores to a pointer in one of the address spaces\n",
    "- Calls for which a value in one of the address spaces is an operand\n",
    "- Calls in jlcall ABI, for which the argument array contains a value\n",
    "- Return instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We explicitly allow load/stores and simple calls in address spaces Tracked/Derived. Elements of jlcall\n",
    "argument arrays must always be in address space Tracked (it is required by the ABI that\n",
    "they are valid `jl_value_t*` pointers). The same is true for return instructions\n",
    "(though note that struct return arguments are allowed to have any of the address\n",
    "spaces). The only allowable use of an address space CalleeRooted pointer is to pass it to\n",
    "a call (which must have an appropriately typed operand).\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, we disallow `getelementptr` in addrspace Tracked. This is because unless\n",
    "the operation is a noop, the resulting pointer will not be validly storable\n",
    "to a GC slot and may thus not be in this address space. If such a pointer\n",
    "is required, it should be decayed to addrspace Derived first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we disallow `inttoptr`/`ptrtoint` instructions in these address spaces.\n",
    "Having these instructions would mean that some `i64` values are really GC tracked.\n",
    "This is problematic, because it breaks that stated requirement that we're able\n",
    "to identify GC-relevant pointers. This invariant is accomplished using the LLVM\n",
    "\"non-integral pointers\" feature, which is new in LLVM 5.0. It prohibits the\n",
    "optimizer from making optimizations that would introduce these operations. Note\n",
    "we can still insert static constants at JIT time by using `inttoptr` in address\n",
    "space 0 and then decaying to the appropriate address space afterwards.\n",
