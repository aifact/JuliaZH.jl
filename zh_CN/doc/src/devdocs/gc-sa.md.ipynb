    "# Static analyzer annotations for GC correctness in C code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The analyzer plugin that drives the anlysis ships with julia. Its\n",
    "source code can be found in `src/clangsa`. Running it requires\n",
    "the clang dependency to be build. Set the `BUILD_LLVM_CLANG` variable\n",
    "in your Make.user in order to build an appropriate version of clang.\n",
    "You may also want to use the prebuilt binaries using the\n",
    "`USE_BINARYBUILDER_LLVM` options. Afterwards, running the analysis\n",
    "over the source tree is as simple as running `make -C src analyzegc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Julia's GC is precise, it needs to maintain correct rooting\n",
    "information for any value that may be referenced at any time GC\n",
    "may occur. These places are known as `safepoints` and in the\n",
    "function local context, we extend this designation to any function\n",
    "call that may recursively end up at a safepoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "In generated code, this is taken care of automatically by the GC\n",
    "root placement pass (see the chapter on GC rooting in the LLVM\n",
    "codegen devdocs). However, in C code, we need to inform the runtime\n",
    "of any GC roots manually. This is done using the following macros:"

    "incorrectly, the result is silent memory corruption. As such it\n",
    "is very important that they are placed correctly in all applicable\n",
    "code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, we employ static analysis (and in particular the clang static\n",
    "analyzer) to help ensure that these macros\n",
    "are used correctly. The remainder of this document gives an overview\n",

    "code base to make things work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GC Invariants\n",
    "\n",
    "There is two simple invariants correctness:\n",
    "- All `GC_PUSH` calls need to be followed by an appropriate `GC_POP` (in practice we enforce this\n",
    "  at the function level)\n",
    "- If a value was previously not rooted at any safepoint, it may no longer be referenced\n",
    "  afterwards\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course the devil is in the details here. In particular to satisfy the second of the above\n",
    "conditions, we need to know:\n",
    "- Which calls are safepoints and which are not\n",
    "- Which values are rooted at any given safepoint and which are not\n",
    "- When is a value referenced\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second point in particular, we need to know which memory locations will be considered\n",
    "rooting at runtime (i.e. values assigned to such locations are rooted). This includes locations\n",
    "explicitly designated as such by passing them to one of the `GC_PUSH` macros, globally rooted\n",
    "locations and values, as well as any location recursively reachable from one of those locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Static Analysis Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea itself is very simple, although the implementation is quite a bit more complicated\n",
    "(mainly due to a large number of special cases and intricacies of C and C++). In essence,\n",
    "we keep track of all locations that are rooting, all values that are rootable and any\n",
    "expression (assignments, allocations, etc) affect the rootedness of any rootable values.\n",
    "Then, at any safepoint, we perform a \"symbolic GC\" and poison any values that are not rooted\n",
    "at said location. If these values are later referenced, we emit an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clang static analyzer works by constructing a graph of states and exploring this graph\n",
    "for sources of errors. Several nodes in this graph are generated by the analyzer itself\n",
    "(e.g. for control flow), but the definitions above augment this graph with our own state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The static analyzer is interprocedural and can analyze control flow across function boundaries.\n",
    "However, the static analyzer is not fully recursive and makes heuristic decisions about which\n",
    "calls to explore (additionally some calls are cross-translation unit and invisible to the analyzer).\n",
    "In our case, our definition of correctness requires total information.\n",
    "As such, we need to annotate\n",
    "the prototypes of all function calls with whatever information the analysis required,\n",
    "even if that information would otherwise be available by interprocedural static analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily however, we can still use this interprocedural analysis to ensure that the annotations\n",
    "we place on a given function are indeed correct given the implementation of said function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The analyzer annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "These annotations are found in src/support/analyzer_annotations.h.\n",
    "The are only active when the analyzer is being used and expand either\n",
    "to nothing (for prototype annotations) or to no-ops (for function like annotations).\n",
    "\n",
    "### `JL_NOTSAFEPOINT`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is perhaps the most common annotation, and should be placed on any function\n",
    "that is known not to possibly lead to reaching a GC safepoint. In general, it is\n",
    "only safe for such a function to perform arithmetic, memory accesses and calls to\n",
    "functions either annotated `JL_NOTSAFEPOINT` or otherwise known not to be safepoints (e.g.\n",
    "function in the C standard library, which are hardcoded as such in the analyzer)\n",

    "indicates that said argument may be passed, even if it is not rooted.\n",
    "In the ordinary course of events,\n",
    "the julia ABI guarantees that callers root values before passing them to\n",

    "to be passed to them even though they are not rooted. Note however, that\n",
    "this does not automatically imply that said argument will be preserved.\n",
    "The `ROOTS_TEMPORARILY` annotation provides the stronger guarantee that,\n",

    "\n",
    "One additional point to note is that these annotations apply on both the\n",
